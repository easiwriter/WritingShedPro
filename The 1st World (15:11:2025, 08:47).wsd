If you are not already familiar with Flarestack Poets' list, we recommend you look at our pamphlets to gain an understanding of the ethos of our press before sending work. Decisions to publish new titles will be based on the quality and suitability of work submitted.\n\nPlease submit a full pamphlet collection of 20-25 pages of poetry, in a readable font such as Times New Roman and spaced as you wish it to appear in print. Poems may have been previously published but should not have appeared together in one collection. Do not include information about previous publication with the poems at this stage but do send a short covering letter giving your postal and email addresses, and outlining your experience in poetry.\n\nSend all your poems in one Word attachment. Poems submitted as several separate attachments will not be opened. The covering letter, however, should be sent as a separate Word attachment. We are not against your submitting simultaneously to other publishers, but we ask you to inform us as soon as your pamphlet is accepted for publication elsewhere. Please send submissions to flarestackpoets@gmail.com, including 'Submission' in the subject.\n \nWe will respond by 31st May 2017 to all manuscripts received but regret we are unable give feedback on unsuccessful submissions.\n\nWe receive no external funding and depend on the revenue from sales of our pamphlets to pay for future publications.\n\nIsabel Palmer & Jacqui Rowe\n\nCo-editors, Flarestack Poets \n\n ",

Submissions for the March issue will now be considered from 1 – 31 October and submissions for the September issue from April 1 – 30. Materials submitted outside these windows will be returned with regret. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, but the change has been forced upon us by the sheer volume of submissions.

      "notesText" : "\nWe are very excited to announce that award-winning poet Jane Draycott is the Judge for the Judge’s Prize for poems of 11 to 50 lines and she will be reading all entries – there are no sifters. The Editors’ Prize is judged by a panel of five Magma Editors and is for poems of up to 10 lines. The prize money for both competitions is the same, so double your chances and try your luck at both.\nFirst prize for the Judge’s and Editors’ Prize £1000, second prize £300 and third prize £150. The six prize-winning poems will be published in Magma, and there will also be five special mentions for the Judge’s Prize and for the Editors’ Prize – each will receive £15. Winning and commended poets will read their poems at a Magma Competition Event in March next year.\nThe entry fees are £5 for the first poem, £4 for the second and £3.50 for the third and each subsequent poem. Magma magazine subscribers benefit from reduced fees: £4 for the first poem, £3 for the second, and £2.50 for the third and each subsequent poem. You can subscribe to Magma from £18.50 via our Get Magma page. The competition closes on 16 January 2017.\nJane Draycott knows a thing or two about writing prize-winning poetry. Her latest collection Over (Carcanet) was shortlisted for the 2009 T S Eliot Prize. Nominated three times for the Forward Prize for Poetry, her first two full collections Prince Rupert’s Drop and The Night Tree (Carcanet\/OxfordPoets) were both Poetry Book Society Recommendations. Her new translation of the 14th century dream-vision Pearl (2011), was a Poetry Book Society Recommended Translation and was a Stephen Spender Prize-winner. The Occupant is forthcoming from Carcanet in November.\nWe asked Jane what she’s looking for in a prize-winning poem. This is what she told us:\n“Strong poems give all the appearance of knowing exactly what they’re doing from start to finish, and that comes often from alert revision, discovering what’s really at the heart of your first draft. But I’ll be looking especially too for poems which move some real distance in their short span – no matter how quietly – where the poem itself has climbed into the driving seat, taking not just its reader but its writer too on an unpredictable journey.”\nGood luck!\n\n \n\nPlease read the Competition Rules and Guidelines carefully before submitting.",

      "notesText" : "http:\/\/poetrysociety.org.uk\n\nSubmissions guidelines\n\nFollow our recommendations here to get the best out of submitting your work to The Poetry Review.\n\nThe Poetry Review welcomes submissions of unpublished poems and ‘literary’ translations of poems. These must be typed and sent as paper copies (not by email) to: The Poetry Review, Poetry Society, 22 Betterton St, London WC2H 9BX.\n\nWe have a policy of publishing work by new and upcoming poets as well as that of established poets. All submissions are read by the editor and considered on an equal basis. Unfortunately, due to the volume of submissions we receive, we cannot offer any individual criticism. Our aim is to accept or reject work within three months – but please read, and follow, the submission guidelines in order to facilitate our response.\n\nSubmission guidelines (for all writers)\n\n• Send a maximum of six poems to be considered for an issue.\n• Only send unpublished work.\n• We do not consider simultaneous submissions, i.e. work that is being considered elsewhere.\n• Poems should be typed – and on one side of the page.\n• Please put your name and address at the foot of each page, as this helps us keep track.\n• Include a cover note containing your address and email. You may add a brief publication history (but this won’t affect your chances).\n\nIf you are submitting from outside the UK:\n\n• Please submit your work via Submittable. There are separate options for members and non-members of the Poetry Society:\n\nIf you are submitting from the UK:\n\n• For the time being, poets submitting from the UK must send work by post to the address above, including a stamped SAE for a response. We are happy to return your work but include sufficient postage if you want us to do so.\n\nThe Poetry Review receives many thousands of poems of which we print only a fraction. So don’t be discouraged by a rejection from us. You will find an extensive list of other poetry magazines to try on the Poetry Library website.\n\nTrustees and staff of The Poetry Society may not submit material for publication in The Poetry Review.\n\nThe Poetry Review\nThe Poetry Society\n22 Betterton Street\nLondon WC2H 9BX\nEmail: Sophie Kirk, poetryreview@poetrysociety.org.uk\nTelephone: 020 7420 9880\n\nGet one-to-one feedback on your work from our highly qualified poet tutors – either in person, or by post",

      "notesText" : "http:\/\/www.prolebooks.co.uk\/\n\nSubmissions\n\nSubmissions for Prole, Poetry and Prose are open.\n\nSubmission guidelines.\n\nProle promotes accessible literature of high quality. Anything that we publish will be intelligent, engaging and impact the reader in a variety of ways. We want to appeal to a wide audience and reconnect a broad readership with excellent examples of poetry and short prose. Anything that sniffs of literary elitism is highly unlikely to make it through the editorial process. If it does, it’s only because we won’t have noticed and the piece has other areas of merit. Obscure references and highly stylised structures and forms that exist only to aggrandise the writer and appeal to the coffee lounges of our older universities are not welcome.\n\n \n\nRemember, at Prole, it’s the reader who comes first. Anything that is accepted for publication will be considered to be: intelligent, engaging and likely to impact the reader in a variety of ways.\n\n \n\nReading previous copies of Prole will help writers to get a flavour of what we are about. Previous copies are available .\n\n \n\nAll submissions should be in English and be free of grammatical and spelling errors.\n\n \n\nAll submissions should be your own, original work and you should hold all rights.\n\n \n\nWe do not accept work that has been previously published in print or e-zines. We will consider work that has appeared on social writing websites such as blogs and free membership writing sites. However, we do expect pieces to be removed from these sites before submission. We do not accept simultaneous submissions.\n\n \n\nProse submissions.\n\n \n\nShort story and creative non-fiction submissions are welcome. We are open to most themes, although we do not accept fan fiction. There is an upper word limit of 7500 words, but pieces of a shorter length are more likely to be accepted if the quality is right.\n\nAll submissions should be contained within the body of an email. You should include your legal name, contact details, word count and a short, third person author bio of no more than one hundred words.\n\n \n\nTo save time: all prose should be single spaced; plain arial font should be used; paragraphs should be single spaced unless you want to indicate a significant break; single speech marks should be used.\n\nSend all prose submissions to: submissionsprose@prolebooks.co.uk\n\nPlease type ‘submission’ in the subject line.\n\nAny email with an attachment will be deleted without being read.\n\n \n\nPoetry submissions.\n\n \n\nWe are open to all forms of poetry whether it be structured or free, rhymed or blank, light or serious; we consider content and quality over form. Patience Strong inspired verse is discouraged. Individual poems are accepted, but we would prefer to see a small collection of up to five pieces. If you are submitting more than three poems, please limit the number of lines to sixty per poem. If you wish to submit longer poems, please limit yourself to a maximum of three pieces.\n\nAll submissions should be contained within the body of an email. You should include your legal name, contact details, word count and a short, third person author bio of no more than one hundred words.\n\nTo save time: all poetry should be single spaced unless you want to indicate a significant break; plain arial font should be used; single speech marks should be used.\n\nSend all poetry submissions to: submissionspoetry@prolebooks.co.uk\n\nPlease type submission in the subject line.\n\nAny email with an attachment will be deleted without being read.\n\n \n\nCopyright:\n\n \n\nCopyright will remain with our contributors. A standard contract will be sent out on acceptance.\n\n \n\nArtwork Submissions.\n\n \n\nWe are open to submissions for front cover design. The design should be portrait orientated, measure 210mm x 148mm and be greyscale\/black and white. These words should appear: Prole, poetry and prose, issue x - x being the issue you are submitting for.\n\nInitial submissions should be sent as attached PDFs. On acceptance, we will request jpg format. You should include your legal name, contact details and a short, third person bio of no more than one hundred words. Send all artwork submissions to: submissionsprose@prolebooks.co.uk\n\nPlease type artwork in the subject line.\n\n\nCopyright:\n\n\nCopyright will remain with our contributors. A standard contract will be sent out on acceptance.\n\n \n\nPayment.\n\n \n\nOn publication, every accepted contributor will receive a PDF version of the hard copy. We aim to give each contributor a monetary payment. Profits will be shared in the following way:\n\nFour months from the publication date, profits made from the sale of the issue your work appears in will be calculated.\n\n50% of any profit will be retained by Prole.\n\n50% of any profit will be shared out between our contributors on a proportional points system.\n\nEvery poem published will score 1 point.\n\nEvery piece of prose published will score 3 points.\n\nCover design will score 1 point.\n\nPayments will be worked out in a proportional nature.\n\nFor example: the whole publication contains 30 poems and 10 short stories. The publication has a points value of 60. £500 profit is made. A writer has five poems published and therefore holds five points.\n\n50% of profit is retained by Prole = £250\n\n50% of profit is shared between writers = £250\n\nIn the example given, our writer holds 5 points out of 60. His\/her payment will be:\n\n(5 ÷ 60) x £250 = £20.83\n\nAll payments will be made by PayPal.\n\n \n\nExceptions:\n\nIf profit made means any writer will receive less than £1 (UK sterling) no payments will be made to any writer.\n\nAny profit made from sales of the publication that occur after four months will be retained by Prole.\n\n \n\nWe realise that this method is a little rough and ready. However, it provides us with the opportunity to pay writers without going broke!",

This is so that we can post a response to you. We do not respond to postal submissions by e-mail. Tell us if you don't need the poems back.\n> Send up to 6 poems.\n> Please put your name and address on every sheet. Our office is full of pieces of paper, and things can slip astray of their moorings.\n> We have no restrictions on subject matter or style, but remember we're a magazine of contemporary poetry. We have high editorial standards. We look for energy, imagination and technique.\n> We try to reply within 6 weeks of receipt.\n> Taking out a subscription won't affect your chances of publication. But it will win you our love and respect, and help to keep us afloat.\n> We also need good critical articles and reviews to do with contemporary poetry. In first instance, just send us ideas, synopsis, etc.\n \nPostage rates:\n'Large' letters  (which include A4 size) and 'packets' are charged at a higher rate than 'letters'. Please be aware of this when sending us mail - if we are asked to pay excess postage (which is £1 on top of the underpaid amount) we will ask Royal Mail to return letters to the sender.

Let's face it you can move my marbles more than any other bint, at least till all the Wonga firms are skint. My love of racing worms will grow bigger than Blackpool, yet more slow. An hundred years will never faze your main beam in the summer haze. Two hundred more will test your braking. But thirty thousand will do your gears in. There's a built-in life to every part and that includes my aching heart. For, blue lady, take my advice I'll never sell you at any price.\n\n\tBut always in the night I hear\nthe sound of  scrap yards creeping near\nwhen, let's face it, you've got years to go,\nbefore your synchromesh runs slow.\nYour metallic paint job won't be found,\non the local scrap heap, nor the sound\nof my wailing. Let the rust bugs try\nto screw their way to your spare tyre,\nthen watch the salesmen turn to dust\nand into ashes all my lust.\nThe scrapheap's a crappy public place.\nand no one there can start a race.\n\n\tSo, while the turtle wax's shine\nsilks your skin like summer wine,\nand while your ECU runs well\nand  engine screams the din of hell\ncome on girl, put on your face,\nlike loony speeders we will race.\nLet's not pussyfoot past radar traps\nwe'll run the risk of  legal slaps.\nGive me all your strength sweet flower\nand I'll exploit your pulling power\nto tear ass down the promenade\nin a hooting honking serenade.\nMy love there is no parking spot\nfor us. Let's zoom away before we rot.;\n"

The stable door is wide open, there's no sign\nof him anywhere. Those gypsies must have come in the night.\nI finished planing the table leg, told her to calm down.\nIt'll be alright, you'll see. I followed her into the paddock\nand over to the stable by the old farm wall. Sure enough\nthe stable was empty and the door lock was smashed.\nI'm a light sleeper, you know that Marie, yet I heard nothing,\nno banging, no cars, no voices, nothing. Not even the clatter\nof hooves. We'll have to find him Joe, let's go, now, let's take\nthe Landrover and horsebox, call at the neighbours, \nlook in the woods. So we did. We spent all day knocking\non doors, walking over fields, scouring the woods, but\nno one had seen or heard the fabulous beast that Marie found\none day wandering alone in the misty forest. I can't say\nI was sorry he'd gone. He was wild, would bite and kick\nif the mood took him, yet was a cuddly puppy for her.\nWhen the sun started setting we were forced to abandon\nthe search, though Marie wanted to go on through the night.\nJoe, you'll have to tell the insurance people. How can I,\nwhat can I claim for? He didn't cost us anything, just\ntime and patience and his weird food. I'll report it to\nthe police in the morning, they can issue a bulletin.\nAnd that's what I did. I dialled 101 and spoke to a polite\nyoung man who asked me to describe the beast. I explained\nhow he was smaller than an elephant, had the hair\nof a buffalo, head like a wild boar and was most likely\nto be found wallowing somewhere in mud and slime.\nAnd oh, I nearly forgot, there's one more thing, he has \na long black horn spiralling from the middle of his head. \n",

The fish fryer was dismantled and dumped in' the cellar tough why it wasn't taken away I never found out. Maybe he thought he could sell it. I much preferred the confectioners. it meant I could steal custard creams and was sometimes-given stale cakes.

Can't they see\nI've already got too much to do, what with wars and epidemics.\nThe barmy sods believe in blowing themselves up,\nkilling loads of innocent people on the way.\nWell, I can't handle the extra workload. For a start it's messy \ntrying to find their souls among the litter of body parts,\nespecially when they struggle, claim their time hasn't come.\nI'd go on strike, but everyone would think it was a great idea.\nSo instead I'm going to nobble the chief loony as he passes\nthrough the Valley of Death dressed as a knight.\nI've paid the Devil to be there too, to scare his horse so he falls off.\nThen we'll send him back to his Maker.\n\n2 The Devil\n\nThere I was relaxing on a beach near Pandemonium\nwarming myself by the burning sea when who turns up?\nNon other than that creep, the Grim Reaper. \nHe said he needed some help in the Valley of Death\nand was prepared to pay me well. I tried to get a weekend pass \nback to heaven, but he wasn't falling for that. \nHe told me to dress up like a goat with cloven hooves,\nso I've had to buy back my goat suit from the pawnbroker. \nThat was only a couple of hours ago. It seems some nutter\nis expected to march through the valley on a horse.\nHe told me to stamp about and roar like the devil\nso the horse would bolt and throw the lunatic off.\nWhat actually happened was the lunatic had a dog,\nan Irish wolf hound big as a small horse.\nThe bastard animal bit me and pulled off my goat mask.\n\n3 The Believer\n\nThe world is going to the dogs, people. \nIt's full of unbelievers who refuse to follow the Word,\nmy Word, given to me on an acid trip by a power\nfar mightier than me. It is written that unbelievers\nshould be eliminated now---waiting for the Rapture\nis a wait too long. I run the Church of Salvation,\nhave my own TV channel and online merchandising store.\nI have real power. My thousands of followers are prepared\nto give me money to help me cleanse this world.\nToday I was leading a march through Death Valley\nfollowed by a dozen neophytes in need of hardening\nby exposure to the dark forces that inhabit the place.\nBut then that idiot Devil turned up, craven nut,\nprobably under contract. He's always after a fast buck. Anyway,\nthere he stood, dressed like a goat, stamping and snorting,\nso I set my Irish Wolfhound on him. Gnash bit his arse\nand hoicked off his tawdry goat outfit. Then the Grim Reaper\nappeared waving a skull and egg timer in my face.\nWhat's occurring guys? I asked. Why don’t you bugger off\nOr else I’ll report you to the boss. You know he’s my friend.\n\n",

So if there's one thing I can't stand it's single issue fanatics, especially religious fundamentalists. Can't they see I've already got too much to do, what with wars and epidemics. The barmy sods believe in blowing themselves up, killing loads of innocent people on the way. Well, I can't handle the extra workload. For a start it's messy trying to find their souls among the litter of body parts,\nespecially when they struggle, claim their time hasn't come. I'd go on strike, but everyone would think it was a great idea. So instead I'm going to nobble the chief loony as he passes through the Valley of Death dressed as a knight. I've paid the Devil to be there too, to scare his horse so he falls off. Then we'll send him back to his Maker.\n\n2 The Devil\n\nThere I was relaxing on a beach near Pandemonium warming myself by the burning sea when who turns up? Non other than that creep, the Grim Reaper. He said he needed some help in the Valley of Death and was prepared to pay me well. I tried to get a weekend pass back to heaven, but he wasn't falling for that. He told me to dress up like a goat with cloven hooves, so I've had to buy back my goat suit from the pawnbroker. That was only a couple of hours ago. It seems some nutter is expected to march through the valley on a horse. He told me to stamp about and roar like the devil so the horse would bolt and throw the lunatic off. What actually happened was the lunatic had a dog, an Irish wolf hound big as a small horse. The bastard animal bit me and pulled off my goat mask.\n\n3 The Believer\n\nThe world is going to the dogs, people. It's full of unbelievers who refuse to follow the Word, my Word, given to me on an acid trip by a power far mightier than me. It is written that unbelievers should be eliminated now---waiting for the Rapture is a wait too long. I run the Church of Salvation, have my own TV channel and online merchandising store. I have real power. My thousands of followers are prepared to give me money to help me cleanse this world. Today I was leading a march through Death Valley followed by a dozen neophytes in need of hardening by exposure to the dark forces that inhabit the place. But then that idiot Devil turned up, craven nut, probably under contract. He's always after a fast buck. Anyway, there he stood, dressed like a goat, stamping and snorting, so I set my Irish Wolfhound on him. Gnash bit his arse and hoicked off his tawdry goat outfit. Then the Grim Reaper appeared waving a skull and egg timer in my face. What's occurring guys? I asked. Why don’t you bugger off Or else I’ll report you to the boss. You know he’s my friend.\n\n",

After Tonsorial Artiste I actually liked it the best, so I have had to ask myself why. There are two reasons I think. First, I thought the mass of gerunds created movement, but accept that I overdid it. I have now removed some, but not all. Second, I was surprised by how the notes I made at the zoo helped to create something that was not really about the zoo at all. \nI've rewritten the first stanza to introduce the brothers and create a sense of them sitting still and proud in the son.\n\n",

Then after Port \nwhen your powers of speech collapsed\nand your clothes began to peel away—\ntie, shirt, one shoe—and your toupee \nslipped askew, I took my cue to sneak off \nknowing years of executive training \nwould take you up to bed on autopilot \nto sleep the sleep of the ungrateful dead.\n\n",

I imagined the prof\nwalking into a bookstore in the bay area.\n\nWas it a branch of Borders or Barnes \\& Noble? \nIt wouldn't have been the City Lights Bookstore,\nunless Lawrence Ferlinghetti was a closet Smalltalker.\n\nThis diverted my train of thought, though hardly a train,\nmore like a drunk on a pushbike, to recall the time\na famous poet bought my copy of Wallace Steven's letters.\n\nI wondered if the famous poet had googled the name\ninside the book. I imagined the poet's disappointment\nat finding an undertaker, a pest controller, and a taxidermist.\n\n",

          "text" : "Synopsis\n\nI have been writing for just over twenty years. Until 2001 I wrote fiction, mostly short stories, although I did attempt a novel helped by a correspondence course. In 2001 I went on an Arvon course and came away writing poetry, which I think I'd always wanted to write but didn't have the courage (I have read poetry since my early twenties). I stopped working full time in 2002 following redundancy, worked part time for the Open University until 2011, then retired. I have taken a number of poetry writing courses with the Open College of the Arts, been on six Arvon courses (two of them with you, Mimi), lots of poetry school courses, and in 2008 I achieved an MA in Creative Writing from MMU.\n\nI am a regular member of Cross Border Poets, a poetry society stanza in North Wales and I manage www.thedearlist.co.uk, a website advertising poetry events in the North of England. The site issues a weekly email newsletter containing a digest of events.\n\nI have had about thirty poems published in magazines such as The North, Obsessed with Pipework, Envoi, Prole, Interpreter's House along with poems in a number of anthologies. Last year I won first prize in the John Dryden Translation Competition for a collection of poems by Eugenio Montale that I translated in collaboration with Carla Scarano D'Antonio.\n\nI have tried several times, unsuccessfully, to win a pamphlet competition (Poetry Business, Rialto, Cinnamon).\n\nFor two successive years a couple of my poems made it onto the long list of the Poetry Society Competition.\n\nMuch of my time since mid 2014 has been devoted to developing an app for writers called Writing Shed. It runs on iPad and iPhone and was first released in July 2016. I am working on a Mac OS X version that I hope to release in the autumn. This work has had the effect of significantly reducing my writing output.\n\nKeith Lander",

That's our Billy's boy. Seems the police say he's got to wear an ankle tag. _What's happened to the bus?\n I says to Billy, why have they done that? What's he done wrong? But he just mumbled something about throwing stones. Throwing stones at what? I had to know, being as Billy's my son. The old bloke at the corner house he says. You know the one. Bradley and his mates was having fun, giving him some lip. He tells them to bugger off, so they start playing up, using language, throwing stones, smashing windows. _What's happened to that bus?\n It's his mum I reckon. Too soft by half. The little devil runs rings around her, and our Billy, well he's too busy boozing down the club. You need to get a job I keep telling him, but he doesn't care, just laughs. Your Susan'll up and leave you if you don't watch out. I've seen her out and about with her glad rags on. Where does she get the money from I ask him. But he doesn't care as long as she cooks and cleans. _What's happened to that bus?\n If his dad was still alive, God bless him, he'd tell him a thing or two. He worked his fingers to the bone for those two boys. Harry listened, Billy didn't. Look at Harry, why can't you be like him I said. But he just laughed, walked off, said it's his life he can do what he friggin likes. Fine example to Bradley I said. No wonder he's in trouble all the time. _What's happened to that bus?\n\n",

          "text" : "Sarin\n\nSarin, an organophosphorus compound originally created as a pesticide, is a colorless, odorless liquid, used as a chemical weapon owing to its extreme potency as a nerve agent. It has been classified as a weapon of mass destruction in UN Resolution 687. Production and stockpiling of sarin was outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 where it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance.\n\nOn April 25th 2013, United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel issued a letter to Congress stating US intelligence agencies had collected evidence that Syrian army forces under President Bashar al-Assad had used sarin on a small scale against rebel fighters.\n\nBashar al-Assad stands on the shoulders of other great single-issue fanatics.\n\nIn 1950 20-year-old Ronald Maddison, an RAF engineer, died in human testing of Sarin at Porton Down. He was told it was a test for finding a cure for the common cold. A secret inquest returned a verdict of misadventure.Thank you Clement Atlee.\n\nIn 1970 US aircraft deliberately dropped sarin on US defectors in Laos. This was a covert operation. It never happened. Thank you Richard Nixon.\n\nIn 1988 the Kurdish city of Halabja in Northern Iraq was bambarded with chemical weapons, including sarin. An estimated 5000 poeple died. Thank you Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn 1995 the Aum Shrinikyo sect realeased sarin gas into the Tokyo subway killing 13 people, severely injuring 50, and temporarily causing vision problems for a 1000. Thank you the members of Aum Shrinikyo.\n\nInitial symptoms following exposure to sarin are a runny nose, tightness in the chest and constriction of the pupils. Soon after, the victim has difficulty breathing and experiences nausea and drooling. As the victim continues to lose control of bodily functions, the victim vomits, defecates and urinates. This phase is followed by twitching and jerking. Ultimately, the victim becomes comatose and suffocates in a series of convulsive spasms.\n\n",

Around the same time I met my first love, Pammy, at Ann Longden's party. She was Jewish and dad said I shouldn't have anything to do with her. \n\nIn 1948 dad flew a Douglas Dakota to Sydney and back. He was taking a plane load of Russians to a conference. That's what it says in his log book. He was away for three weeks and mum says I didn't know who he was when he got back. She says I came rushing into the house shouting that a stange man was getting out of daddy's car. He'd grown a moustache while he was away. The photograph album shows that it snowed a lot that year.\n\nIn 1969 I sailed to New York on the QE2. I was working for Ferranti Automation at the time, so this was work, not pleasure. The ship sailed through a hurricane somewhere off the eastern seaboard of America and I was so seasick I needed an injection to stop me heaving. There was an American lady at breakfast one day eating a boiled egg perched in an an egg cup in the middle of a plate of bacon.\n\nIn 1957 I sat the eleven plus and passed. I had no idea what it meant, but dad forced me to do the practice tests. I ended up choosing to go to his old school three miles away instead of the one down the road.\n\nIn 1965 I went to see Bob Dylan at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. This was the last all-acoustic concert he played. A year later he was called Judas at the same venue. I went with Pammy and my new friend from university. His name was Richard B and he was a poet.\n\nIn 1951 I learned how to climb a lampost, the old-fashioned sort that had bars at the top for resting a ladder. Mum had all her teeth taken out at home. I remember seeing lots of blood-stained towels.\n\nIn 1967 I left university and started work. Mum and dad came to collect me and my belongings. I remember him saying that I could put 'all that' behind me now and come into the 'real world'. I never saw Richard B again. A few months later I crashed my new car and never saw Pammy again.\n\nIn 1958 the Busby Babes, heroes of my adolescence, were killed in the Munich air disaster. I would never catch the bus to a match again, ever. Dad left home for a while. I remember wishing he hadn't come back.\n\\poemend",

It's my way \nof being different from the Beatles crowd.\n\nI love a loud Appalachian banjo picker \nor an old-time Kentucky fiddler \nor a Mississippi bluesman playing mean.\n\nBut not as mean as that gravel voice—\nFreewheelin' Bob, don't think twice it's Bob,\nnot a dream, just Bob,\n\nhard rain Bob, jokerman Bob\ncoming though the Gates of Eden\njust like a rollin' stone.\n",

He wonders how it happened.\n\nI remember, it came to me in a dream  —  yes — that was it — it came in a dream. This dream.\n\nI am sitting on a beach — my fingers dancing on the keyboard recording sense impressions in a fractured syntax about limpets attached to a rock in front of me. I sit there for hours — staring at limpets — searching for meaning — typing until the tide comes in and begins to cover them.I feel the cold of the incoming tide — but still I type on —and on — recording the changes to the limpets that do not move. \n\nAs the water rises higher I lift the laptop — keeping it dry —until it's perched on top of my head. I carry on recording my feelings of the submerging limpets — my fingers dancinglike Jimi Hendrix playing guitar on top of his head. I hold my breath to the point of drowning — then wake up wet to find a laptop in my hair— but I don't own a laptop — and have never learned how to type. Convinced I am dreaming I go back to sleep.\n\nI am awakened by sunshine streaming through the window and the sound of the sea lapping on the shoreline. Moved — I reach for my notebook— to write down my dream. I can't find it — but find the laptop still in my hair — with its chips still clamped to my head like limpets to a rock.\n\nI take a stroll down the beach — need time to plan the next move —after all — I don't own a laptop. I walk for a while to a small cove — a place I visit in times of uncertainty — a secluded spot with rock pools and the stink of seaweed at low tide. To my dismay I find that someone is already there — a woman — sitting — staring at the rocks and weeping. I approach with caution —ask her what's wrong. She looks — is surprised to see me —says she's lost her laptop (she is looking at the laptop clamped to my head). Last night I dreamed I was sitting here — writing my notebook — describing the limpets —when the tide came in and it wound up here (she points to a notebook in her flaxen hair).I explain that I've had the same dream too — but she wasn't in it. \n\nShe unclamps the laptop from my head and I untangle the notebook from hers. We look at the limpets — they haven't moved. I tell her she can be in my dream if I can be in hers.",

And guess who won the raffle: non but master hacker Milo newly returned from an undercover operation inside Mr C. Milo, Dream Lord, wanderer of the fifth dimension, was always game for anything. Time, the scourge of humankind, found him swigging absinthe, clutching his winning ticket. He woke up near the Bastille in a tumbril.\n",

He horrified you. You didn't like it there Too much noise. Too many people.\nWe were at the Munich Hirschgarten sitting in the Spring sun a gang of us gathered to drink map on map of cold bier served by barmaids dressed in din di and sing along to the oomph band.\nLater, walking back ears the port past a herd of grazing deer, I offered you a shoulder ride like I'd done when you were small. I should have seen the terror in your eyes as I lifted you in the air, felt your fear\nas I proceeded to gallop, a drunken horse, around the park until the curse I was tripped and fell hurting you headlong to the ground. I'll never forget the sound of your yell and how I stupidly said You'll be ok\n_\nYour mother gave me one of her looks as one of our friends, a nurse, picked you up and felt for the broken arm you swore I'd given you. it was ok\ncarried the bruise for decades while .\nbut\nyou've\nI've drowned myself in endless glasses of shame.\nAll this war over forty years ago when we were young and I was hooked on a habit it took forty years to break.

I have added a line to remedy this by suggesting that what follows is what the narrator sees.\nThe second stanza was a messy list. It shows that I didn't spend enough time working on the notes it came from. I have moved things round and removed a few words, so now I think it flows much more smoothly.\nAs suggested I removed the roadway from the third stanza and tweaked the final stanza.  \n\n",

          "text" : "Walking the dogs\n\nAlthough one week of April is behind us\ntoday is the first decent day of Spring.\nI decide to go for a long walk with the dogs,\nset off downhill along a road called *The Dell*,\nleading onto a country lane.\nA brook burbles along beside me before dropping\nout of site under a tangle of Rhodedendron bushes.\nI stop by a stile, think of walking across the fields,\ndecide it's too marshy and the way is unclear.\nThe stile reminds me of my eldest daughter who\nas a girl was terrified of climbing over them.\nThe dogs are quite happy with the bevy of new smells\nand I'm soaking up the sun and fresh air.\nThere's a tidy farm on the left with a few sheep\nin the field next to the house. Lambs bleat\nand hens peck at the grass. A sign advertises free range eggs.\nShe was always a strange girl, conscientious though,\ndid well at school. One year, I suppose she was about sixteen,\nshe and her friend won five hundred quid in a school competition.\nThey had to come up with a novel idea for a holiday\nso they suggested visiting twenty-six towns in Europe \none for each letter of the alphabet, so Paris was P,\nRome was R and so on. I can't remember what Z was.\nThey promised to phone home regularly, but went dark\nfor two weeks. I never found out why. Boys I suppose.\nThere's a junction up ahead so I turn right onto a road\nthat carries intermittent traffic. I need to keep the dogs\non the same side, stop them wandering onto the carriageway.\nIt's a bit boring this stretch, but the exercise is good for me.\nShe got a place to read economics at Cambridge, but then\nflunked one of her school exams. She blamed the teacher.\nAnyway she went to Bristol instead where I found lodgings\nin a nice house owned by a young couple who offered\nto pay her to babysit from time to time. She only stayed\na few weeks before moving into a university flat, sharing\nwith a few wealthy ex-public school girls. She changed.\nThere's a tractor coming towards me, one of the huge ones\nwielding viscious looking poughing machinery behind it.\nI climb onto the grass verge to get out of its way.\nFurther along there's a right turn into a narrow lane.\nBy now my legs are aching, convincing me that I'm unfit.\nA van drives past and parks some way down the lane.\nShe got a good degree and started work with one of\nthe large firms of accountants where she studied for\na year or two more to become a qualified accountant.\nShe was living in London by now and has never returned.\nI see the van driver place a basket of pigeons on the roof.\nHe releases the birds and I watch them dart over the fields.\nThen he climbs into the van and drives off down the lane.\nI'm sure his birds give him great pleasure, but not sure how.\nTwenty years have gone by, she's married, has three daughters\nof her own, and lives in a grand house in the home counties. \nI've slowly lost touch with her. It was probably the divorce.\nI turn back onto the estate past the Tank Shed, so named\nbecause that's what it was in the war, or so I've been told.\nLast week she came to visit with her family. First time\nI've seen her for five years. I don't know why she came\nbecause somehow she avoided talking to me: never asked\nhow I was or what I've been doing, and was reticent when\nI asked about how life was treating her. Then she was gone.\nI'm back home with the dogs, outside the door. My legs ache.\nI can still see her standing here saying goodbye, telling me not\nto phone, but only use email. I remember my tears of joy\non the day she was born, and ask myself why, why why.",

The world would judge him\ninsanely great if he walked a high wire\nstretching out into space between the twin towers.\n\nNot God though, who knew the man was a basket case\nin need of aid from the highest quarter. “Let's face it\ndivine ones”, he said to his team, “He needs our help,\na personal minder, or he'll wind up as pulp”. \n\nEnter Derek, who answered the advert placed by God\nfor an experienced angel: fit, bright, with good\nflying skills. Derek was made for the job\nhaving worked for years in the bungee trade.\n\nWhen the Frenchman stepped on his strand of wire,\na catenary curving through the grabless air,\nhe was protected by Derek and a host of angels\ncontracted to help him cover all angles.\n\nBut down on the ground in the din of Manhattan\nwhat they saw that day will not be forgotten:\nthe funambulist dancing in the morning haze\nwas a puppet on strings who, totally unfazed\n\nby the prospect of a thousand-foot fall from grace,\nthrew nonchalant waves from his sacred place\namong Derek's angels in their mystic domain:\nthe invisible stuff of impossible dreams.\n\n",

I'm not saying it screamed and faught with me, it was more subtle than that. I sat it on the passenger seat and set off to drive the twenty miles to the repair shop in Warrington. In less than five miles I ran in to the first of its delaying tactics - road works on Acton bridge over the river Weaver.A couple of miles further another holdup for roadworks on the A49 in Stretton and a long delay. When we made it onto the M56 I thought I was home and dry, but then the motorway signs said the M6 was blocked by a diesel spill. Another diversion, this time all the way to Dunham Massey through Lymm and on towards the east side of Warrington, even being made to pay 12p to cross an old toll bridge over the Manchester ship canal. Then something went badly wrong. My mobile rang. It was the repair shop calling to say that I needed to take Milo to their branch in Manchester instead. How did it do that? - organise traffic jams, rearrange the appointment. Maybe Milo has a sixth sense, maybe there is more to the Internet than we know. \n\\end{verse \n\n"

But why\nasked a boy walking past with his dad.\nWho needs this refuge, this place to hide,\nsanctuary, asylum, a warm bed?\nThe man told the boy it was one more place\nfor those grey-faced people on Oxford road\nto keep themselves warm at work each day\nin the warp and weft of King Cotton's gold.\nNow the smog has lifted from the painting\nyou can see to the end of Oxford Road,\nto where, at Christmas, a daft red giant \nwith a sack of presents floats to and fro \nabove King Cotton, a million miles\nand ninety years from his counting house\nstill dressed in red brick, but now a hotel:\na refuge for the slick and self-assured\nwho spin their cloth from alchemic gold.\n\t\nSaturday, 12 November 2011 at 15:35",
