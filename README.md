### Data Models
```swift
@Model final class Project {
    var id: UUID
    var name: String
    var type: ProjectType  // prose, poetry, drama
    var creationDate: Date
    var details: String?
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade)
    var folders: [Folder]  // 3 root folders per project
}

@Model final class Folder {
    var id: UUID
    var name: String
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade)
    var folders: [Folder]  // Nested folders
    @Relationship
    var parentFolder: Folder?  // Hierarchy support
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade)
    var files: [File]
    var project: Project?
}

@Model final class File {
    var id: UUID
    var name: String
    var content: String = ""
    @Relationship
    var parentFolder: Folder?
}
```

### Auto-Generated Folder Template

When you create a project, 15 folders are automatically created:

```
Project (e.g., "My Poetry")
├── Your Poetry
│   ├── All
│   ├── Draft
│   ├── Ready
│   ├── Set Aside
│   ├── Published
│   ├── Collections/
│   ├── Submissions/
│   └── Research/
├── Publications
│   ├── Magazines/
│   ├── Competitions/
│   ├── Commissions/
│   └── Other/
└── Trash
```

## 🎓 How This Was Built

### Methodology: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. Write specification (requirements, user stories)
2. Write tests for each feature
3. Implement code to pass tests
4. Refactor for clarity
5. Document decisions

### Phase Progression
```
Phase 001 (Project Management)
│
├── T001-T026: Project CRUD operations
├── T005-T022: UI components and views
├── T012-T026: 45 comprehensive tests
└── Result: Working project management ✅

Phase 002 (Folder & File Management) 
│
├── T001-T008: Template service
├── T009-T050: Folder management UI
├── T051-T085: File management UI
├── T001-T019: 21 comprehensive tests
└── Result: Working folder/file management ✅

Total: 66 tests, ~4,000 LOC
```

## 🐛 Debugging Guide

### Common Issues

**Folder count wrong (15 instead of 3)?**
- Root cause: SubFolders incorrectly assigned to project.folders
- Solution: Don't set project reference on subfolders
- File: `services/ProjectTemplateService.swift`

**Navigation loop when tapping folders?**
- Root cause: SwiftData predicates with optional chaining failing
- Solution: Use direct property access instead of @Query predicates
- File: `Views/FolderListView.swift`

**Info sheet blank?**
- Root cause: Using `.constant()` bindings instead of state
- Solution: Pass actual `$stateVariable` bindings
- File: `Views/ProjectDetailView.swift`

**Build fails?**
- Solution: `⌘+Shift+K` (clean build), then `⌘+B`
- Check: CloudKit entitlements enabled

See **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** for complete debugging guide.
