# ✅ Complete Implementation Summary
## Both Tasks Completed Successfully

**Date**: 21 October 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Committed to Git + Documentation Complete

---

## What You Asked For

> **User Question**: "Since I finished the spec etc you produced the code and several changes/fixes have been made since including all the tests. My question is how can this be repeated to get to where we are now? Presumably there is a git trace of it that could be replayed?"

> **Your Request**: "Both please" (commit + implementation guide)

## 🎓 Learning Path

**New to the project?** Follow this path:

1. **5 min**: Read `README.md` (understand what exists)
2. **5 min**: Follow `REPLAY_CHECKLIST.md` (verify it works)
3. **20 min**: Read `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` sections 1-3 (architecture)
4. **10 min**: Skim `specs/002-folder-file-management/plan.md` (design decisions)
5. **Open Xcode**, create a project, explore the UI
