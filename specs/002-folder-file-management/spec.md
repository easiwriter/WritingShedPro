# Specification: Folder and File Management (iOS/MacOS)

**Phase:** 002  
**Status:** Planning  
**Dependencies:** [001-project-management-ios-macos](../001-project-management-ios-macos/spec.md)

---

## Context & Prerequisites

### Completed in Phase 001 âœ…
- SwiftData models: `Project`, `Folder`, `File` (already defined)
- CloudKit sync with automatic ModelContainer configuration
- Project CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- SwiftUI navigation and list views
- Localization infrastructure with `Localizable.strings`
- Validation services (`NameValidator`, `UniquenessChecker`)
- Comprehensive test coverage (45+ tests)

### Existing Architecture (Reference)
See: [`001-project-management-ios-macos/plan.md`](../001-project-management-ios-macos/plan.md)

**Key Patterns to Maintain:**
- MVVM with SwiftUI `@Query` for reactive data
- Service-based validation and business logic
- Optional properties for CloudKit compatibility
- `NSLocalizedString()` for all UI text
- LOcalization infrastructure
- TDD with unit and integration tests

### Data Models Already Available
```swift
// From Phase 001 - BaseModels.swift
Project {
    folders: [Folder]?  // Relationship ready
}

Folder {
    name: String?
    folders: [Folder]?      // Nested folders
    parentFolder: Folder?   // Hierarchy support
    files: [File]?          // Contains files
    project: Project?       // Parent project
}

File {
    name: String?
    content: String?        // Ready for text editing
    parentFolder: Folder?   // Belongs to folder
}
```

## Overview

Enable users to organize their writing projects using folders and files. Users can create nested folder hierarchies within projects and add files to folders, with all data syncing via CloudKit.

### UI Reference
The folder navigation displays a hierarchical structure organized by category with custom SF Symbols:

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Allow users to create folders within projects
2. Support nested folder hierarchies (folders within folders)
3. Enable file creation within folders
4. Provide folder and file navigation UI
5. Implement rename and delete for folders and files
6. Maintain CloudKit sync for all operations
7. Creation of each project create a set of top level folders listed and grouped as follows 
    1. Type related e.g Your Poetry
        - All: lists all files from Draft, Ready, Set Aside and Published
        - Draft: for draft files
        - Ready: for files ready for submission
        - Set Aside: for files not being worked on
        - Published: for files that have been published
        - Collections: contains folders that contain files collected prior to submission
        - Submissions: contains collections that have been submitted for publication
        - Research: contains files & folders containing research material.
    1. Publications
        - Magazines: folders named for magazine
        - Competitions: folders named for competitions
        - Commissions; folders name for commissions
        - Other: catch all folders
    1. Trash
        - Trash: folder containing deleted items

### Non-Goals (Future Phases)
- Rich text editing within files (Phase 003)
- Images embedded within files (Phase 3)
- File templates or formatting
- Bulk operations (move multiple items)
- Search functionality
- Export/import

- **FR1.2:** Support unlimited nesting depth
- **FR1.3:** Rename folder (validates uniqueness at same level)
- **FR1.4:** Delete folder (cascade deletes children)
- **FR1.5:** Display folder count (number of items inside)

### FR2: File Operations
- **FR2.1:** Create file with unique name validation (within folder)
- **FR2.2:** Rename file (validates uniqueness within folder)

### FR3: Navigation
- **FR3.1:** Breadcrumb or hierarchical navigation
- **FR3.2:** Back button to parent folder
- **FR3.3:** Display current location in navigation bar

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Folder/file lists load instantly (< 100ms for < 1000 items)
- CloudKit sync happens in background without blocking UI

### NFR2: Usability
- Consistent UI patterns with Phase 001 (sheets, forms, alerts)
- Clear visual distinction between folders and files (SF Symbols)
- Intuitive navigation (standard iOS patterns)

### NFR3: Localization
- All new UI text uses `NSLocalizedString()`
- Support same languages as Phase 001 (initially English)

### NFR4: Accessibility
- All interactive elements have accessibility labels
- VoiceOver support for folder/file navigation
- Dynamic Type support for text

### NFR5: Testing
- Unit tests for folder/file validation
- Integration tests for CRUD operations
- UI tests for navigation flows

---

## Technical Constraints

### TC1: Existing Architecture
- Must use existing `Folder` and `File` models from Phase 001
- No changes to Project model structure
- Maintain CloudKit compatibility (optional properties, defaults)

### TC2: Platform Support
- iOS 18.5+ and macOS 14+ (MacCatalyst)
- Same multiplatform approach as Phase 001

### TC3: Dependencies
- SwiftUI for all UI
- SwiftData for persistence
- CloudKit for sync (automatic via ModelContainer)

## Open Questions

1. **Q:** Should we limit folder nesting depth?  
   **A:** TBD - Start with unlimited, monitor performance

2. **Q:** File extensions (e.g., .txt, .md)?  
   **A:** TBD - Defer to Phase 003 (text editing)

3. **Q:** Folder/file sorting options?  
   **A:** Follow Phase 001 pattern (alphabetical, creation date)

4. **Q:** Show item counts in folder list?  
   **A:** Nice-to-have, not MVP
