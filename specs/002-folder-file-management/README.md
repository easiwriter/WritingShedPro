```

### Key Documents

#### 1. **spec.md** - Full Specification
- References Phase 001 architecture and decisions
- Defines 6 user stories (folder + file management)
- Lists functional and non-functional requirements
- Identifies open questions and success metrics
- **Context-aware**: Knows about existing models and patterns

#### 2. **requirements.md** - Implementation Checklist
- Verifies Phase 001 prerequisites
- Breaks down all requirements into actionable items
- Organized by feature area (folders, files, navigation, testing)
- Includes definition of done

#### 3. **quickstart.md** - Getting Started Guide
- Overview of Phase 002 scope
- Implementation approach (step-by-step)
- Project structure changes
- Testing strategy
- Success criteria

## What's Different from Phase 001

### âœ… Context Awareness
- Spec **explicitly references** Phase 001 models and services
- No duplication - builds upon existing `Folder` and `File` models
- Reuses validation patterns, UI components, and architecture

### âœ… Incremental Development
- Folder and File models already exist (from Phase 001)
- Only need to add UI and navigation layers
- Maintains CloudKit compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing features

### âœ… Clear Dependencies
- Phase 002 depends on Phase 001 being complete
- References existing files and patterns
- Builds on established conventions

## Next Steps with SpecKit

### Option 1: Generate plan.md and tasks.md
Tell Copilot:
```
Generate plan.md and tasks.md for Phase 002 folder and file management.
Reference the architecture decisions from Phase 001 and reuse existing
patterns for validation, UI, and testing.
```

### Option 2: Start Implementation Directly
Tell Copilot:
```
Implement Phase 002 folder management features. Start with US1 (Create Folder
in Project). Follow TDD approach like Phase 001. Reuse existing BaseModels.swift
and validation services.
```

### Option 3: Review and Refine Spec
Tell Copilot:
```
Review Phase 002 spec.md and suggest improvements based on Phase 001
implementation learnings.
```

## How SpecKit Will Use This

When you ask Copilot to work on Phase 002, it will:

1. âœ… **Read Phase 002 spec.md** - Understand new features
2. âœ… **Reference Phase 001 spec/plan/tasks** - Understand existing architecture
3. âœ… **Examine existing code** - See BaseModels.swift, validation services, UI patterns
4. âœ… **Generate context-aware implementation** - Reuse patterns, no duplication
5. âœ… **Maintain consistency** - Same coding style, test approach, localization

## Benefits of This Structure

### ðŸŽ¯ Clear Progression
- Phase 001: âœ… Complete (Project management)
- Phase 002: ðŸ“‹ Ready to start (Folder/file management)
- Phase 003: ðŸ”® Future (Text editing)

### ðŸ”— Linked Documentation
- Each phase references previous phases
- No lost context between implementations
- Easy to understand dependencies

### ðŸ“¦ Modular Development
- Each phase is independently specified
- Clear scope boundaries
- Easy to prioritize and schedule

### ðŸ¤– AI-Friendly
- SpecKit can easily understand phase relationships
- References are explicit and clear
- Context is preserved across phases

## Files Updated

âœ… **Phase 001 spec.md** - Added "Status: Complete" and link to Phase 002  
âœ… **Phase 002 created** - Full spec with references to Phase 001  
âœ… **Requirements checklist** - Ready for implementation tracking  
âœ… **Quickstart guide** - Clear next steps

---

## Ready to Go! ðŸš€

Your project now has:
- âœ… Complete Phase 001 implementation
- âœ… Structured Phase 002 specification
- âœ… Clear path for incremental development
- âœ… Context preserved across phases

**When you're ready to start Phase 002, just tell Copilot and it will know exactly what to do based on these specs!**
