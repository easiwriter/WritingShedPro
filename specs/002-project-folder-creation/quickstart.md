# Quickstart: Folder and File Management

**Phase:** 002  
**Status:** Planning  
**Prerequisites:** [Phase 001 Complete](../001-project-management-ios-macos/quickstart.md)

---

## Overview

This phase adds folder and file management capabilities to the Write! app, allowing users to organize their writing projects using hierarchical folder structures and create files for individual documents.

## Prerequisites

### From Phase 001 ✅
- Working Write! app with project management
- SwiftData models (Project, Folder, File) already defined
- CloudKit sync configured
- Test infrastructure in place

### Before Starting Phase 002
- [ ] Verify all Phase 001 tests passing
- [ ] Verify app builds and runs on iOS/Mac
- [ ] Verify CloudKit sync working
- [ ] Review existing Folder and File models in BaseModels.swift

## Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Folder Management (P1)
1. Create folder list view within project detail
2. Implement folder creation (AddFolderSheet)
3. Add folder rename and delete
4. Enable nested folder navigation

### Step 2: File Management (P2)
1. Create file list view within folders
2. Implement file creation (AddFileSheet)
3. Add file rename and delete
4. Show file metadata and content preview

### Step 3: Navigation
1. Implement hierarchical navigation
2. Add breadcrumbs or back navigation
3. Handle empty states

### Step 4: Testing & Polish
1. Write unit and integration tests
2. Add localization strings
3. Add accessibility labels
4. Update documentation

## Key Features

### 📁 Folder Management
- Create folders within projects
- Create nested folders (unlimited depth)
- Rename folders with validation
- Delete folders with cascade (removes all contents)
- Navigate folder hierarchy

### 📄 File Management
- Create files within folders
- Rename files with validation
- Delete files with confirmation
- View file metadata
- Content preview (read-only for now)

### 🧭 Navigation
- Hierarchical navigation (folders within folders)
- Back button to parent folder
- Current location shown in navigation bar
- Empty state messages

### ☁️ CloudKit Sync
- All folders sync across devices
- All files sync across devices
- Automatic conflict resolution

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Folder name validation
- File name validation
- Uniqueness checking (folder/file within context)
- Cascade delete logic

### Integration Tests
- Create folder in project
- Create nested folders
- Create file in folder
- Rename and delete operations
- Navigation flows

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Users can create folders in projects
- ✅ Users can create nested folder hierarchies
- ✅ Users can create files in folders
- ✅ All rename and delete operations work with validation
- ✅ Navigation is intuitive and follows iOS patterns
- ✅ All data syncs via CloudKit
- ✅ Test coverage matches Phase 001 standards
- ✅ No breaking changes to Phase 001 features

---

## Next Steps

1. Review this spec and requirements checklist
2. Generate plan.md and tasks.md using SpecKit
3. Begin implementation with TDD approach
4. Follow Phase 001 patterns for consistency
