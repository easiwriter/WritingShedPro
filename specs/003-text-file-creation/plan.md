# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Data Model Implementation
- [ ] Create `TextFile` model in `BaseModels.swift`
- [ ] Update `Folder` model to include `textFiles` relationship
- [ ] Test data model with sample data
- [ ] Verify CloudKit sync functionality

## Phase 2: UI Components
- [ ] Create `AddTextFileSheet` view for file creation
- [ ] Create `TextFileEditorView` for editing content
- [ ] Create `TextFileRowView` for file list display
- [ ] Update `FolderDetailView` to show text files

## Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Add text file creation button to folder views
- [ ] Implement file deletion functionality
- [ ] Add file rename capability
- [ ] Test complete user workflow

## Phase 4: Polish
- [ ] Add file validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement auto-save functionality
- [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 2-3 hours
- Phase 2: 4-5 hours  
- Phase 3: 2-3 hours
- Phase 4: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 10-14 hours

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with Phase 1 to validate data model approach
- Test CloudKit sync early to catch integration issues
- Keep UI simple initially, enhance later
- Maintain existing functionality throughout development
