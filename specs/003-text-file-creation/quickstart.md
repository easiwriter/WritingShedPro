# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started with Text File Creation & Versioning

### Overview
This feature adds text file creation and editing with built-in version control to blank projects in WritingShedPro. Users can create, edit, and manage text files with full revision history within the "All" folder of any blank project.

### Key Components

#### 1. TextFile Model (Container)
- New SwiftData model for file metadata
- Contains versions array and current version pointer
- Integrates with existing Folder structure

#### 2. Version Model (Content)
- Stores actual text content and version metadata
- Belongs to TextFile parent
- CloudKit sync enabled

#### 3. UI Components
- `AddTextFileSheet`: Create new text files
- `TextFileEditorView`: Edit file content with version support
- `VersionNavigationView`: Navigate between versions
- `TextFileRowView`: Display files in lists

#### 4. User Workflow
1. Create blank project (existing functionality)
2. Navigate to "All" folder
3. Tap "+" to create new text file
4. Enter file name and initial content
5. Save automatically (creates Version 1)
6. Edit content and create new versions
7. Navigate between versions as needed

### Implementation Order
1. **Data Models**: Start with `TextFile` and `Version` models
2. **Basic UI**: Add file creation sheet
3. **Editor**: Implement text editing view
4. **Versioning**: Add version navigation and creation
5. **Integration**: Connect to folder views
6. **Polish**: Add validation, error handling, and version management

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for data model
- Integration tests for folder relationships
- UI tests for complete workflow
- Manual testing on device and simulator

### Minimal Viable Product
- Create text file in "All" folder
- Edit text content
- Save changes with automatic versioning
- Navigate between versions
- Delete files (and all versions)
- Basic error handling

This focused approach with built-in versioning ensures we deliver core writing functionality with powerful revision control from day one.
