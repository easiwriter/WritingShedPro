# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]

**Target Platform**: iOS 17+, macOS 14+ (via MacCatalyst)
**Project Type**: Multiplatform (iOS + MacCatalyst)

```
ios/                  # iOS-specific SwiftUI modules, views, flows
macos/                # MacCatalyst-specific modules, views, flows
models/               # Shared data models (Project, File, Folder)
services/             # Shared business logic, data sync, CloudKit
tests/
  ├── unit/           # Unit tests for models/services
  └── integration/    # Integration tests for flows
```

**Structure Decision**: Use multiplatform Xcode app with iOS and MacCatalyst targets. Shared models/services maximize code reuse. Tests are organized by type. This approach ensures a unified codebase and consistent UX across platforms.
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
