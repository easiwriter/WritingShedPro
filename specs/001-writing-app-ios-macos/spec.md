# Feature Specification: Writing App for iOS and MacOS

**Feature Branch**: `001-writing-app-ios-macos`
**Created**: 20 October 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a Writing Application that works on IOS and MacOS, but do this incrementally"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Edit Documents (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create, edit, and save text documents on both iOS and MacOS so that I can write and access my work across devices.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition and enables the primary use case for the application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating, editing, and saving a document on either platform and verifying it is accessible and editable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is installed, **When** the user creates a new document, **Then** the document is saved and accessible for editing.
2. **Given** a saved document, **When** the user opens it on another device, **Then** the content is available and editable.

### User Story 2 - Sync Documents Across Devices (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want my documents to sync automatically between iOS and MacOS so I can seamlessly continue my work on any device.

**Why this priority**: Syncing enhances usability and user satisfaction by providing a seamless cross-device experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by editing a document on one device and verifying the changes appear on the other device after sync.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a document is edited on iOS, **When** the user opens the app on MacOS, **Then** the latest changes are present.
2. **Given** a document is deleted on one device, **When** the app syncs, **Then** the document is removed from all devices.

### User Story 3 - Organize Documents (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to organize my documents into folders or categories so I can manage my writing projects efficiently.

**Why this priority**: Organization features help users manage multiple documents and projects, improving productivity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating folders/categories and moving documents between them.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple documents, **When** the user creates a folder and moves documents into it, **Then** the documents are grouped accordingly.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the user loses internet connection during sync?
- How does the system handle conflicting edits from different devices?
- What if a document fails to save due to storage limits?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create, edit, and save text documents on both iOS and MacOS.
- **FR-002**: System MUST sync documents automatically between devices when connected to the internet.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to organize documents into folders or categories.
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle offline edits and sync changes when reconnected.
- **FR-005**: System MUST resolve conflicting edits with a user-friendly conflict resolution process.  
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear error messages if saving or syncing fails.
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure user data is securely stored and transferred.  

### Key Entities

- **Document**: Represents a user-created text file, with attributes such as title, content, last modified date, and associated folder/category.
- **Folder/Category**: Represents a grouping for documents, with a name and a list of contained documents.
- **User Account**: (If required for sync) Represents the user, with credentials and associated documents/folders. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is user authentication required for sync or can documents sync without accounts?]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create, edit, and save a document on either platform in under 2 minutes.
- **SC-002**: 95% of document syncs complete within 10 seconds after reconnection.
- **SC-003**: 90% of users successfully organize documents without assistance.
- **SC-004**: User-reported sync or save errors are below 2% of total sessions.
- **SC-005**: 95% of users rate the cross-device experience as "satisfactory" or better in post-launch surveys.

## Assumptions

- Users expect a simple, intuitive interface for writing and organizing documents.
- Standard cloud storage practices are used for syncing documents.
- Reasonable defaults for error handling and offline support are assumed.
- The application will be released incrementally, starting with core writing and saving features, followed by sync and organization.
