## Pre-Testing Checklist

Before starting manual tests:
- [ ] Build succeeds (`⌘+B`)
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] App launches successfully (`⌘+R`)
- [ ] Have a Writing Shed v1 JSON export file ready (for import testing)
- [ ] Can open a text file in FileEditView

---

## Feature 1: Collections/Submissions Folder Separation

### Background
**Issue**: After legacy import, Collections folder was showing all items (54 total) instead of only collections (5), and Submissions folder was empty instead of showing submissions (49).

**Root Cause**: Import logic was checking wrong attributes and not properly decoding the `collectionSubmissionIds` plist data.

**Fix**: Now correctly decodes the plist and checks if the array is empty:
- Collections: Items with empty or missing `collectionSubmissionIds`
- Submissions: Items with non-empty `collectionSubmissionIds`

### Test Steps

#### Test 1.1: Fresh Import (Recommended)
1. **Prepare Test Data**
   - Use a Writing Shed v1 JSON export that contains both collections and submissions
   - Note the expected counts from the legacy app

2. **Delete Existing Data** (to test clean import)
   - Delete the app from simulator/device
   - Or: Settings → Reset all data

3. **Import Legacy Data**
   - Launch app
   - Go to Settings → Import
   - Select your Writing Shed v1 JSON export
   - Wait for import to complete

4. **Verify Collections Folder**
   - Navigate to Files → Collections
   - ✓ Should show only collections (expected: 5 items in test case)
   - ✓ Items should NOT have submission markers/indicators
   - ✓ List sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive)

5. **Verify Submissions Folder**
   - Navigate to Files → Submissions  
   - ✓ Should show only submissions (expected: 49 items in test case)
   - ✓ Items may have collection/group metadata
   - ✓ List sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive)

6. **Verify Total Count**
   - Collections count + Submissions count = Total legacy items
   - ✓ All items accounted for
   - ✓ No duplicates
   - ✓ No missing items

#### Test 1.2: Sorting Verification
1. **Check Collections Sort Order**
   - Open Collections folder
   - Note the item names
   - ✓ Items sorted A-Z
   - ✓ Case-insensitive (e.g., "apple" comes before "Banana")
   - ✓ Uses localized comparison (handles accents, special chars)

2. **Check Submissions Sort Order**
   - Open Submissions folder
   - Note the item names
   - ✓ Items sorted A-Z
   - ✓ Case-insensitive
   - ✓ Uses localized comparison

#### Expected Results
| Folder | Expected Count (your data may vary) | Notes |
|--------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| Collections | 5 | No `collectionSubmissionIds` or empty array |
| Submissions | 49 | Non-empty `collectionSubmissionIds` array |
| **Total** | **54** | All items from legacy import |

### Troubleshooting
- **Collections folder empty**: Check if items have `collectionSubmissionIds` set
- **All items in Submissions**: Verify legacy JSON structure
- **Wrong counts**: Check console logs for import errors
- **Unsorted lists**: Verify `localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare` is working

## Feature 5: Collections/Submissions UI Enhancements (NEW)

### Background
**Date Added**: 2 February 2026

UI improvements to the collections and submissions workflow:

#### Test 5.3: Publication Submissions Button
1. **Create Test Data**
   - Create a collection with some files
   - Submit the collection to a publication
   - Navigate back to Collections folder

2. **Verify Button Appears**
   - ✓ Collection row now shows `book.badge.plus` button (between name and ellipsis menu)
   - ✓ Button only appears if files have been submitted to publications
   - ✓ Tapping button opens sheet showing publication submissions

3. **Check Submissions View**
   - Navigate to Submissions folder
   - ✓ Submission rows also show the `book.badge.plus` button when applicable
   - ✓ Tapping shows same publication submissions sheet

4. **Verify Sheet Content**
   - Tap the `book.badge.plus` button on a collection
   - ✓ Sheet title is "Submissions"
   - ✓ List shows publications the files were submitted to

| 1.0x | Normal size | Default |
| 1.5x | 50% larger | Comfortable reading |
| 2.0x | Double size | High visibility |
| 3.0x | Triple size | Maximum zoom |

### Troubleshooting
- **Pinch doesn't work**: Verify on iOS device (not macOS)
- **Zoom doesn't persist**: Check UserDefaults key `textViewZoomFactor`
- **Zoom resets**: Verify transform applied in `makeUIView`
- **Layout broken**: Check `CGAffineTransform` scaling

   - Try scrolling up further
   - ✓ Stops at top, no over-scroll
   - Scroll to bottom of document
   - Try scrolling down further
   - ✓ Stops at bottom, no over-scroll

#### Test 4.2: No Interference with Tapping
1. **Single Finger Tap**
   - Tap with one finger to place cursor
   - ✓ Cursor moves to tap location

3. **Text Selection**
   - Tap and drag with one finger to select text
   - ✓ Selection works normally
   - ✓ No scrolling interference
   - ✓ Selection handles appear

#### Test 4.3: Combined Gestures
1. **Zoom + Scroll**

   - Lift fingers
   - Immediately tap with one finger
   - ✓ Tap registers correctly
   - ✓ No gesture confusion

3. **Scroll + Select**

|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Tap | 1 | Place cursor, no scroll |
| Drag | 1 | Text selection, no scroll |
| Scroll | 2 | Content scrolls vertically |
| Pinch | 2 | Zoom in/out |
| Image tap | 1 | Image selection |

### Troubleshooting
- **Scroll doesn't work**: Verify exactly 2 fingers used
- **Interferes with selection**: Check `minimumNumberOfTouches = 2`
- **No bounds checking**: Verify `maxOffsetY` calculation
- **Works on macOS**: Feature is iOS-only (UIKit gestures)
